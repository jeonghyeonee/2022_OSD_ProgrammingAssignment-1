The following command can run:
- __pwd__: an abbreviation of ‘print working directory’
- __ls__: another to list their contents
- __ps__: a utility called ps for viewing information related with the processes on a system which stands as abbreviation for “Process Status”
- __cat__: short for “concatenate“
- __exit__ or __quit__: exit and quit command in linux is used to exit the shell where it is currently running
- __cd__: an abbreviation for ‘change directory’
    - __cd__ or __cd ~__: cd on its own is a quick shortcut to get back to your home directory
    - __cd .__: change into the current directory or, in other words, the command will do nothing
    - __cd ..__: To go up to the parent directory, in this case back to “/”, use the special syntax of two dots (..) when changing directory 
    - __cd '_Relative Path_'__: That is, the place you end up at depends on your current working directory
    - __cd '_Absolute Path_'__: No matter what your current working directory is, they’ll have the same effect
    - __cd '_Not Exist Directory_'__: print out no such file or directory
- __history__:  keeps a list of all the other commands that have been run from that terminal session, then allows you to replay or reuse those commands instead of retyping them
- __!!__: execute the previous command
- __!#(_number_)__: execute the nth command from the history
